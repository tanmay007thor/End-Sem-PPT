\begin{frame}{Abstract}


		This work explores sleep stage classification using preprocessed EEG data (Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz channels) converted into .pkl format from the Sleep-EDF dataset. The cleaned and normalized data is fed into various machine learning and deep learning models. Notably, ensemble methods and XGBoost achieved high accuracy, while Bi-LSTM demonstrated strong performance in deep learning. Despite challenges in classifying the N1 and REM stages, the system shows robust multi-class classification capabilities.
		
		\begin{block}{\textbf{Best Accuracy Achieved}}
			\textbf{XGBoost: 85.3\%}, \textbf{Bi-LSTM: 81.1\%}, \textbf{Random Forest: 84.2\%}
