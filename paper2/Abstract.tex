\begin{frame}{Abstract}
	This work explores sleep stage classification using preprocessed EEG data (Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz channels) converted into .pkl format from Sleep-EDF. The cleaned and normalized data is served into various ML and deep learning models. Notably, ensemble and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy, while Bi-LSTM offered strong deep learning performance. Despite challenges in classifying N1 and REM stages, the system demonstrates robust multi-class capability.
	\begin{block}{\textbf{Best Accuracy Achieved}}
		\textbf{XGBoost: 85.3\%}, \textbf{Bi-LSTM: 81.1\%}, \textbf{Random Forest: 84.2\%} â€” showing promising results for automated sleep analysis.
